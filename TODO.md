# TODO

**Current Status**: Core functionality complete with comprehensive config flow and reconfiguration testing. Integration setup, config flow, and reconfiguration flow tests are complete (27 tests passing). Cover entity logic test plan has been updated to accurately reflect the actual implementation in cover.py. Next step is implementing the detailed cover entity logic tests.

- [x] **Project Setup**
  - [x] Ensure `custom_components/mappedcover/` exists with `__init__.py`, `manifest.json`, `sensor.py`, `const.py`
  - [x] Update `manifest.json` with correct domain, name, and metadata

- [x] **Config Flow**
  - [x] Implement `config_flow.py` to allow UI-based configuration
  - [x] Prompt user to select an existing cover entity (exclude covers from this integration)
  - [x] Create the new cover with an ID and default name derived from the mapped cover
  - [x] Allow reconfiguration of each new entity using the UI

- [x] **Remapping Logic**
  - [x] Add options for:
    - [x] Max position (user-defined)
    - [x] Min position (user-defined, 0 still maps to 0)
    - [x] Detect if the selected cover supports tilt
    - [x] Max tilt position (if supported, user-defined)
    - [x] Min tilt position (if supported, user-defined, 0 still maps to 0)
  - [x] Store remapping configuration

- [x] **Entity Creation**
  - [x] Create a new cover entity representing the remapped cover
  - [x] Forward commands to the selected cover, remapping positions/tilts as configured

- [x] **State Reporting**
  - [x] Always report the target position/tilt as the current state while moving
  - [x] Sync state with the underlying cover when not moving

- [ ] **Unit Testing**
  - [x] **Test Infrastructure**
    - [x] Set up pytest with Home Assistant testing framework
    - [x] Configure conftest.py with custom component copying for integration tests
    - [x] Reorganize test files with meaningful names (test_integration_setup.py, test_config_flow.py)
  - [x] **Integration Setup**
    - [x] Test that the integration loads successfully
    - [x] Test that the domain is correctly registered
    - [x] Test that the config flow is properly configured
  - [x] **Config Flow**
    - [x] Test that the config flow shows user step with label and covers fields
    - [x] Test that only valid, non-mapped cover entities are selectable (exclude existing mapped covers)
    - [x] Test that configure step shows remapping fields with conditional tilt support
    - [x] Test that submitting the two-step config flow creates an entry with the correct data
    - [x] Test that min/max values are validated (throw exceptions for invalid ranges)
    - [x] Test that tilt options are only shown if the selected entity supports tilt
    - [x] **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
      - [x] Test error handling when entity registry access fails (internal_error abort)
      - [x] Test edge case: no covers available to select
      - [x] Test edge case: mixed tilt support (some covers support tilt, others don't)
    - [x] **Input Validation**
      - [x] Test validation that at least one cover is selected (vol.Length(min=1))
      - [x] Test voluptuous range validation edge cases (exactly 0, exactly 100)
      - [x] Test string field validation (empty label, malformed regex patterns)
    - [x] **Default Values & Configuration**
      - [x] Test default values are properly applied from constants
      - [x] Test optional fields have correct defaults (close_tilt_if_down, throttle)
    - [x] **Helper Functions**
      - [x] Test supports_tilt function error handling (missing state, malformed attributes)
      - [x] Test build_remap_schema with various tilt_supported scenarios
  - [x] **Reconfiguration Flow**
    - [x] **Basic Reconfiguration**
      - [x] Test that the reconfigure flow can be started for an existing mapped cover
      - [x] Test that reconfigure flow shows existing values and allows modification
      - [x] Test that reconfigure uses async_update_reload_and_abort to apply changes
      - [x] Test that changes persist after reconfiguration
    - [x] **Advanced Reconfiguration**
      - [x] Test reconfigure step with unique_id handling and mismatch abort
      - [x] Test reconfigure preserves existing entry data and title
      - [x] Test reconfigure redirects through user step correctly
      - [x] Test reconfigure vs new entry code paths in async_step_configure
